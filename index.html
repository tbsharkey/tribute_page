      <p> Marvin Minsky was an American scientist who specialized in artificial intelligence. Born in New York in 1927 he went on to serve in the US Navy in 1944-45 before starting college. He started working at MIT in 1958 and is the founder of the MIT Computer
        Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He worked at MIT until his death in 2016.<br>
        Mr. Minsky was known as a pioneer in artificial intelligence. He believed that the human mind is no different from a computer. He believed that intelligence emerged from a series of numerous and simple agents rather than one system. His work inspired
        generations of students and his fundamental work in computer science and AI have helped create the modern world that we live in. Mr. Minsky passed away in January 2016 at the age of 88.
